# Sketch Machine

The Sketch Machine (www.sketchmachine.net) wants you to draw; it's waiting for you. The Sketch Machine is a quick and simple way to create short, looping animations and to turn them into GIFs to share through the web. 

Sketch Machine was created by Casey REAS (http://caesuras.net/) in 2018, with help from GIPHY. It was created within the tradition of “direct animation” works by Len Lye and Stan Brakhage and exploratory drawing software like TURUX.
