Bugs / Regressions / Issues

X Export speeds are still off, I tweaked but not quite right?
  . What is the precise math?
   + I have no idea - it's supposed to be milliseconds.
     + :( - I think there are inaccuracies on both sides!
     + GIF encoding/playback and browser timing/rendering.
     !+ Update: Looks like GIFs work in centiseconds
         + I followed the data: https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js/blob/master/src/GIFEncoder.js#L93-L95
         + http://www.onicos.com/staff/iz/formats/gif.html#gceb 2 bytes for 1/100ths of a second here.
     + So the 'mathematically correct' fix is to change all fpsOptions to multiples of 10. I bet we will still see some variation though. :(
     ??? So I did this... it seems worse? Maybe I missed something.
     - Edit: Seems great except at highest speeds.

Finished

X Preload 'play.svg' so there is no flicker on first click.

X Giphy export
  x Worked on FireFox OS X 10.10.3, but had to enable pop-ups
  x Didn't go to Giphy site on Chrome OS X 10.13.3
    x Update: It worked, but the pop-up blocker so subtle, I didn't see it
    ^ This is acceptable I think... the alternative would be to show a link, or jump the page...
  x Link to "Find all the Sketch Machines GIFs on Giphy."

x Clicking and holding mouse without moving it no longer draws just once?
x "Select All" for the timeline button isn't styled correctly

x Unicode figures in the buttons have different borders on different browsers
  x Arows too low within the button on some browsers
  x Stop/pause button is off center on some browsers/OSs
    . Firefox MacOS 10.13.3, too small and at the bottom
  x Switch to SVG image buttons?

x Clicking on a frame in the timeline doesn't jump to that frame
  x Right now, dragging works, but not clicking
  x Update: fixed a little, but not 100%

o Explore additional Tools
  . Grid
  . Square
  . Compass

x Default to 512 resolution
  . I switched it, but I think retina devices go back to 1024
  . Too slow on my phone @ 1024
  . Hacked it a bit, not looking at the pixelDeviceRatio anymore

x Timeline should be taller, it shrinks on small screen sizes and it's difficult
  to get with fingers on a phone

x If more than one tool is selected, "sluggish" is diminishing, not sluggish
  . pulled it out of the "mark" functions
